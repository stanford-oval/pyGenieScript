# Packaged GenieScript for Python

GenieScript's core engine is originally built in Java/TypeScript. This is its language extension in Python.
The goals of this package include:

- An easy installation, directly from `pip`
- Expose the GenieScript engine as a set of easy-to-use APIs, enabling it to be used in larger Python projects
